This is a recording. History is written by the victors. History is full of lies. If he is alive and we are dead words, his truth will be recorded. And we will be erased. Shepherd will be a hero. Because you want to change the world did was a good lies and rivers of blood. He will soon complete history of the great lies. He's the truth will be the truth. But only when he live down, and we die.

Ordinary people don't wake up in the morning thought this is the last day of life. But I think this is a luxury, rather than curse. Know yourself numbered is a relief. The liquidation over. No weapon. With a pair of hundreds. By hot heads to carry out a suicide mission. But here's the sandstorm and rock has been the thousands of years of war defiled. We will therefore be remembered. For in our endless nightmare, it is our own choose to enter. We will be like the mind jumps out of lava general forward. We had our hearts, the clear goal: we, and killed him.
